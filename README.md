## Key Concepts

### Agent Experience Optimization (AXO)

AXO is the practice of structuring and presenting web content so that LLM agents can easily crawl, understand, archive, and reference it. The core principles are captured in the **CLEAR Framework**:

*   **Concise:** Lead with key facts.
*   **Logical:** Use a clear heading hierarchy.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Include specific data and sources.
*   **Accessible:** Use semantic HTML and schema markup.
*   **Referenceable:** Create self-contained, citable sections.

### Key Protocols

The agentic economy is being built on a foundation of open protocols:

| Protocol | Purpose | Key Players |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol - for context sharing | Anthropic |
| **A2A** | Agent-to-Agent Protocol - for agent coordination | Google |
| **AP2** | Agent Payments Protocol - for secure payments | Google, Visa, Mastercard |
| **ACP** | Agentic Commerce Protocol - for commerce flows | OpenAI, Stripe |
