## Playbook 1: AI Agent Optimization

### The Agentic Commerce Opportunity

The scale of the agentic commerce opportunity is staggering:

*   **$1 trillion** in US B2C retail revenue could be orchestrated by AI agents by 2030.
*   **$3-5 trillion** in global revenue is projected by 2030.
*   **1300%** growth in AI agent traffic was observed in just 9 months.
*   **40%** of enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026.

### Key Concepts: Agent Experience Optimization (AXO)

AXO is the practice of structuring and presenting web content so that LLM agents can easily crawl, understand, archive, and reference it. The core principles are captured in the **CLEAR Framework**:

*   **Concise:** Lead with key facts.
*   **Logical:** Use a clear heading hierarchy.
*   **Evidence-Based:** Include specific data and sources.
*   **Accessible:** Use semantic HTML and schema markup.
*   **Referenceable:** Create self-contained, citable sections.

## Playbook 2: AI Reputation Management

### The Challenge of AI-Driven Misinformation

AI systems are increasingly shaping how people discover and perceive brands. This creates new risks:

*   **Hallucination rates** range from 15-52% across major LLMs.
*   **42%** of users have reported inaccurate or misleading content in Google AI Overviews.
*   **Over 40%** of users rarely or never click through to source material from AI Overviews.

### Key Concepts

*   **Proactive Monitoring:** Continuously track how your brand is portrayed across AI platforms.
*   **Source Correction:** Correct the underlying sources of misinformation, not the AI outputs themselves.
*   **Proactive Reputation Building:** Create and promote high-quality content that accurately reflects your brand.
