## SOP 1: Initial Triage and Assessment

**Objective:** To quickly assess the severity and potential impact of an instance of AI-driven misinformation.

**Steps:**

1.  **Document the Misinformation:** Take a screenshot of the AI-generated response and record the full text of the misinformation.
2.  **Identify the Platform(s):** Determine which AI platform(s) are generating the misinformation.
3.  **Assess the Severity:** Use the Misinformation Triage Matrix (see Monitoring Templates) to rate the severity of the misinformation on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe.
4.  **Determine the Potential Impact:** Consider the potential impact of the misinformation on your brand, including its potential to damage your reputation, mislead customers, or create legal liability.
5.  **Assign a Priority Level:** Based on the severity and potential impact of the misinformation, assign a priority level (High, Medium, or Low) for correction.

## SOP 2: Source Identification and Correction

**Objective:** To identify and correct the underlying source of the misinformation.

**Steps:**

1.  **Identify Potential Sources:** Use the AI-generated response and your own research to identify the likely sources of the misinformation.
2.  **Contact the Source:** If the source is a third-party website or publication, contact the publisher to request a correction.
3.  **Update Your Own Content:** If the source is your own website or another online property that you control, update the content to correct the misinformation.
4.  **Publish New Content:** If necessary, publish new content to counter the misinformation and provide accurate information.
5.  **Document Your Efforts:** Keep a record of all of your efforts to correct the misinformation, including any correspondence with third-party publishers.

## SOP 3: Monitoring and Follow-Up

**Objective:** To monitor the effectiveness of your correction efforts and ensure that the misinformation does not reappear.

**Steps:**

1.  **Continue to Monitor:** Use your AI reputation monitoring tools to continue to track the instance of misinformation.
2.  **Verify the Correction:** Once the source of the misinformation has been corrected, verify that the AI platform(s) are no longer generating the incorrect information.
3.  **Follow Up as Needed:** If the misinformation reappears, repeat the source identification and correction process.
4.  **Report on Your Progress:** Provide regular updates to your stakeholders on your progress in correcting the misinformation.
